# spxx

> Simple pixel extension written in C on top of
> [spxe](https://github.com/LogicEu/spxe.git). While spxe provides a very
> simple and lightweight way to set up a pixel perfect render context on top of
> OpenGL, it does not include functionality to draw shapes and
> do other kinds of low level graphics manipulations. This extension provides right
> out of the box and ready to use functions to easily render primitive shapes, draw
> text and do other kind of common graphics operations.
